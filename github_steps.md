# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
You want to go into that repository, fork it, then go to the clone drop down and make sure you are in SSH then copy the link. Once you've done that go to your terminal and type git clone and paste link.
